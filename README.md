# everforest-walls

Collection of wallpapers I recolored to the [Everforest colorscheme](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest)

Recolored for Hard Dark, using the old palette (before [c7d3ffe](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest/commit/c7d3ffec0a4725c5154c824f0d036fa26a40232a))

Newer wallpapers will have a `_1` or `_2` suffix. 1 means that the highlights are recolored to around #d3c6aa (the main foreground color) and 2 means that they are instead #859289 (gray1 or the comment foreground color)
